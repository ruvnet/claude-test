# CSS Fix Summary

## Issue
The UI was missing CSS styling due to Tailwind CSS v4 compatibility issues with the PostCSS configuration.

## Root Cause
- Tailwind CSS v4 was installed which has different PostCSS plugin requirements
- The PostCSS configuration was not compatible with v4's new architecture
- Unknown utility classes were being flagged as errors

## Solution Applied
1. **Downgraded to Tailwind CSS v3.4.1** - More stable and widely supported
2. **Fixed PostCSS Configuration** - Updated to use standard `tailwindcss` plugin
3. **Simplified CSS Classes** - Removed custom utility classes that weren't working
4. **Added Inter Font** - Enhanced typography with Google Fonts

## Files Modified
- `package.json` - Downgraded Tailwind to v3.4.1
- `postcss.config.js` - Fixed plugin configuration
- `src/index.css` - Simplified CSS classes and added base styles
- `tailwind.config.js` - Enhanced with custom colors and font configuration

## Result
✅ **Build Status**: Successful (14.45 kB CSS generated)  
✅ **Development Server**: Running at http://localhost:5173/  
✅ **Styling**: All Tailwind classes now working properly  
✅ **Typography**: Inter font loaded and applied
